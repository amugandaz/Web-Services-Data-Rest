# Web-Services-Data-Rest

This project focuses on developing a data-driven RESTful web service with Spring Boot and a client-side Angular application to consume the API. The goal is to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a Book Store model, using a relational SQL database and adhering to HATEOAS principles for API design.
